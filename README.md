A modern web application to manage your DESCO electricity accounts, view balances, consumption data, and get AI-powered insights.

## üôè Acknowledgments

This application is built using the **open APIs provided by DESCO (Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited)**. I'm incredibly grateful to DESCO for making their customer data APIs publicly available, which allows developers like me to create convenient tools for customers.

While DESCO already provides excellent official Android and iOS apps, as well as their web portal, I found myself wanting a more personalized dashboard experience. This project is my attempt to create something that feels more convenient for my own usage patterns - with AI-powered insights, better data visualization, and a modern interface.

**Thank you, DESCO, for your commitment to transparency and customer service through open APIs!** üôè
